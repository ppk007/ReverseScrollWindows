# ReverseScrollWindows
PowerShell script to reverse the scroll direction on Windows machines for **ALL SCROLLING DEVICES**. Scrolling up moves the contents of the window up and scrolling down moves it down. This is the way it works on touchscreens and Mac OS. Some people find it more intuitive.

If you do not want to change the behavior for all scrolling devices on your computer, please do not use this script.

To undo this, run the script with the -Reset commandline parameter. This will reset the scrolling behavior to the Windows default behavior for **ALL SCROLLING DEVICES**.

To use:
1. Download ReverseScrollWindows.ps1
2. Run it
3. If you are on the Windows Insider list and download often, it might useful to put it in Documents\WindowsPowershell and add that directory to your path
